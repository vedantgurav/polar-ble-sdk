# Polar Verity Sense Optical heart rate sensor

Optical heart rate sensor is a rechargeable device that measures userâ€™s heart rate with LED technology.

## Polar Verity Sense features available by the SDK

* Heart rate as beats per minute. 
* Heart rate broadcast.
* Photoplethysmograpy (PPG) values.
* [PP interval](./../PPIData.md) (milliseconds) representing cardiac pulse-to-pulse interval extracted from PPG signal.
* Accelerometer data with sample rate of 52Hz and range of 8G. Axis specific acceleration data in mG.
* Gyroscope data with sample rate of 52Hz and ranges of 2000dps. Axis specific gyroscope data in dps.
* Magnetometer data with sample rates of 10Hz, 20Hz, 50HZ and 100Hz and range of +/-50 Gauss. Axis specific magnetometer data in Gauss.
* [SDK mode](../SdkModeExplained.md) from version 1.1.5 onwards.
* [Offline recording](../SdkOfflineRecordingExplained.md) from version 2.1.0 onwards.

## Important considerations

> [!IMPORTANT]
>Any file transfer is **prohibited** when Polar Verity Sense is in internal recording or swimming mode. Attempting to list, fetch or delete any offline recording
will return `SYSTEM_BUSY` error. Device must be in **sensor mode** (the "heart" on the optical leds, blue side LED) to be able to interact with its files. Reason behind this behavior is to prevent attemps to sync a training session while it's still ongoing.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Polar Verity Sense PPI algorithm is a separate algorithm than the HR one used when PPI data is not being requested. When PPI recording is enabled, HR is only updated every 5 seconds. Also it takes around 25 seconds for the first sample batch to be sent to the offline recording file or over BLE for streaming. As PPI recording is incompatible with the notion of training, enabling PPI recording **will abort any ongoing training** (internal training or swimming).
>
> If movement is detected, the heart rate is fixed to the last reliable value.
> 
> Also, attempting to set `TRIGER_EXERCISE_START` with PPI measurement type when using the offline recording triggered settings will return `ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`
>

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Skin contact detection is very unreliable in Polar Verity Sense. Skin contact of PPI packets should not be trusted, and it might be possible for the device to output a heart rate that is not 0 even the device is not worn. That is a limitation of the older generation of optical heart rate solution.
